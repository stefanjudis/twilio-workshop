For the whole day we'll work on a slimed down version and reimplement the functionality for chat, video and whatsapp.

## How will we work

Have a look [at the issues](https://github.com/stefanjudis/twilio-workshop-final/issues) and solve them one by one. :) Choose your path and build what you like. ‚úåÔ∏è

## Local development

Clone the repository and run `npm install`. Copy the `.env` sample file and fill it with the needed credentials.
You can find instruction in [this GitHub isse](https://github.com/stefanjudis/twilio-workshop-final/issues/1).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:stefanjudis/twilio-workshop-final.git
$ npm install
$ cp .env.sample .env
$ npm start
```

To start the local environment run `npm start`. `localhost:8888` will be available. üéâ
