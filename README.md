## Workshop files

// TODO add button to reduced version

For the whole day we'll work on a slimed down version and reimplement the functionality.

## How will we work

Have a look [at the issues](https://github.com/stefanjudis/twilio-workshop-final/issues) and solve them one by one. :) Choose your path and build what you like. ✌️
